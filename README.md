# Preposal Lab

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

My idea for my final project is to create a Mad Libs game. The game will have a table of contents where the user picks which story they would like to play. Then the user blindly enters a series of verbs, nouns, pronouns, and adjectives which will be generated into an existing storyline and print the story with the words they entered. After the user reads his or her story they will be given the option to choose another story or end the game. 

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

I will be working alone for this project.

## Do you have any questions of your own?

My only question is if this idea is substaintial enough to meet the expectations of the final project and if not, what elements could be added?
